The project was created for a university Java course. It was developed by me and my colleague from the same program. It is one of our first Java projects, so please forgive us if it does not fully follow clean code principles.

The application was built using Spring and JavaFX.

Additionally, even though the documentation incorrectly refers to the project as having a microservice architecture, I am aware that it is actually a simple monolith.

The repository contains the source code of the application as well as documentation written in Polish.
The documentation includes project assumptions, requirement specifications, business processes, user descriptions, and more.
I encourage you to take a look at it.
